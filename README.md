This file is used to created the average '12th man' substitute rating, as well as any other data processing required for the analysis. Example_dataset_2 was created using the original dataset of example_dataset_1. This dataset was used to create descriptive statistics and run the overall analysis. 

## Creating wide format with avg for subs
This file contains all the data processing required to complete the analysis. The dataset was formatted ready for descriptives and the multinomial logistic regression to be completed.

## 2SD Descriptives
This file contains all the code used to calculate the descriptive type statistics across the dataset. This information was used for Table 1 and Table 2


## Bayesian Model Approach
This file contains all the code used to perform the Bayesian multinomial regression modelling. This analysis was completed and the information used to create Figure 1.
